---
04th October 2017
> Cryptography or cryptology (from Greek κρυπτός kryptós, "hidden, secret"; and γράφειν graphein, "writing", or -λογία -logia, "study", respectively) is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries

## A Project Introduction

This project intends to use some of the latest front end technolgies with some of the oldest algorithms known.



## Intended Functionality (Use Cases)
- users should be able to input data and encypt the text with a supported cipher
- users should be able to input encrypted text and providing the specific cypher is known they can decrypt the text
- users should be able to utilize a variety of tools within the application to analyse an encypted text to help identify the cipher key
- users should be able to access a variety of help resources to assist in understanding cryptographic concepts and ciphers

## Simple Project Plan

1) Build a simple User Interface
2) Build a JavaScript Library to handle the cryptographic logic

Regular project diary posts will be uploaded to this site on a regular basis - outlining any key design decisions made, development steps and any challenges encountered.

## Technologies

- Vue.js:
- Bulma CSS
